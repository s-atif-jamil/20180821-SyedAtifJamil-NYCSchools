* Coding Challenge: NYC Schools *

GOAL: Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions
REQUIREMENTS:
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution. Feel free to be creative with the requirements. Your goal is to impress (but do so with clean code).
Create a browser based or native app to provide information on NYC High schools.
1.	Display a list of NYC High Schools. 
1.	Get your data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2
2.	Selecting a school should show additional information about the school 
1.	Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing. 
1.	SAT data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4
2.	It is up to you to decide what additional information to display
When creating a name for your project, please use the following naming convention:
YYYYMMDD-[First&LastName]-NYCSchools (Example: 20180101-DanielleBordner-NYCSchools)
In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:
What is Important
•	Proper function – requirements met.
•	Well constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
•	Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
•	Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.
What is Less Important
•	Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.
Bonus Points!
•	Unit Tests
•	Additional functionality – whatever you see fit.

iOS:
•	For applications that include CocoaPods with their project code, having the Pods included in the code commits as source is recommended. (Even though it goes against the CocoaPods general rules). 
•	Be sure to use safe area insets.
•	Make sure your app is compatible with iPhone X.
Android:
•	Make sure you are correctly handing any necessary permissions.
•	Please make sure you are using Java. If you want to demonstrate the use of Kotlin, we'd rather you use a combination of both.
As mentioned, you are not expected to function in a vacuum. Use all the online resources you can find, and please do contact us with questions or for interim feedback if you desire.
